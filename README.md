# Python 🐍:

<p align="justify">With the python language, the "pygame" library was used to create the screen and most of the game's elements. The idea was to create a snake using a vector. My main obstacle was the collisions, I solved this point by mapping the positioning of the elements on screen.</p>

### Status:

<p>Finished ✅</p>

### Installation: 🛠️

Krapper requires [`python`](https://www.python.org/downloads/) V3.8+ to run.

First you will need to install the libraries:

`Execute` this command in windows prompt `CMD` or `BASH` after installed python:

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
